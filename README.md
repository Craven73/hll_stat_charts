It is gross, but the initial version was just slapted together one day never refined and then some features added on 

Currently there are four endpoints
- /rcon-url/chart
```json
{
    "gameboard": "https://espt-rp-stats.hlladmin.com/#/gamescoreboard/21683",
    "title": "ESPT vs SYN"
}
```
- /rcon-url/table
```json
{
    "gameboard": "https://espt-rp-stats.hlladmin.com/#/gamescoreboard/21683",
    "title": "ESPT vs SYN"
}
```
- /hlu/chart
```json
{
    "logs": "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1117563211739312269/1163125372913717429/icfsyn1015_log.txt",
